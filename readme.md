This Wear OS app remaps
- long-press action (crown button) to Google Assistant Go (GAG) 
- single press (top button) on a Wear OS watch for Flashlight
- double tap (top button). Enabling accessibility permissions allows for a 3rd option, double tap top button which will override Google Wallet app (in case you don't use Wallet)

Tested devices: TicWatch Pro 5, TicWatch Pro 3
