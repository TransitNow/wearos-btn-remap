# Wear OS Button Remapper
See video https://youtu.be/lqnD2iWeQBI

This Wear OS app remaps the long-press action (crown button) or single press (top button) on a Wear OS watch to Google Assistant Go (GAG).

Optional: Enabling accessibility permissions allows for a 3rd option, double tap top button which will override Google Wallet app (in case you don't use Wallet)

Tested devices: TicWatch Pro 5
