# Wear OS Button Remapper

This Android app remaps the long-press action (crown button) or single press (top button) on a Wear OS watch to Google Assistant Go (GAG).

Optional: Enabling accessbility permissions allows for a 3rd option, double tap top button which will override Google Wallet app (in case you don't use Wallet)


## Installation
Visit https://github.com/TransitNow/wearos-btn-remap/releases/tag/v0.0.01 and download the apk on to your phone
